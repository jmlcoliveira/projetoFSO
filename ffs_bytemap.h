/* operations on bytemaps

   init: initializes in-memory structure that holds bmap addresses
     disk address, in-memory start/end indexes
   CAVEAT: assumes a bmap is 1 disk block

   getfree: first-fit get "howMany" contiguous free entries
     parameters:
       @in: bmapIDX (which bmap to access), "howMany" contiguous
     returns:
       position of the 1st free in the range
     errors:
       -ENOSPC there are no free entries
       those resulting from disk operations
   TBD: "howMany" ignored, only works for 1 entry

   set: set an entry to some value (0/1), UPDATES disk image
     parameters:
       @in: bmapIDX (which bmap to access), entry, value
     errors:
       -EFBIG access outside bmap range
       -EINVAL accessed entry already holds that value
       those resulting from disk operations
