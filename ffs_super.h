  create: To be called by format(), requires NOT mounted as it
          overwrites the in-memory SB structure.
          DOES NOT UPDATE the disk superblock, that must be an explicit                   call to the disk driver write
    parameters:
     @in: disk size (blocks), number of blocks to allocate for inodes
     @out: pointer to superblock structure

  read: reads in a SB from disk, overwrites the in-mem SB structure.
        Requires disk open at the driver level
    parameters:
     @out: pointer to superblock structure

  write: writes the in-mem SB structure to disk.
        Requires disk open at the driver level
    parameters:
     @in: pointer to superblock structure

  get*: gets the relevant BFS info from the in-mem SB
    parameters: none
    returns: unsigned int value or address of region

  NOTE: dirty "bit" of in-memory SB must be set/cleared separately
